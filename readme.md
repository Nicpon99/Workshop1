## Workshop1
Hi everyone, This is my first small Java project from CodersLab's course - "Java Developer".
## Task manager
Application "Task Manager" is a very simple tool that manages your tasks. This app reads your document, manages the content and saves at the end to create your task journal.
## Application description
First of all, when you press "run" button, you can see main menu with four option to choice:
```
Please select an option
add
remove
list
exit
```
- Option ``add`` just as the name suggests is for adding a new task to your journal. After writing this word in console, you will see three questions. After answer on them, your task will be added to your task lists.
- Option ``remove`` is for deleting your tasks from the list. After writing this word, application ask you about number of the task from list what you want to remove.
- Option ``list`` is for viewing your whole list with your tasks.
- Option ``exit`` finishes the application and saves all changes to the file.
